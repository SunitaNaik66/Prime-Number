A prime number is a natural number that meets the following two conditions:
**Greater than 1**: A prime number must be an integer greater than 1. The number 1 is not considered a prime because it only has one positive divisor (itself).
**Divisible only by 1 and itself**: A prime number cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and the number itself, meaning it has no divisors other than these two.
**Key Properties of Prime Numbers:**
2 is the only even prime number: Every other even number can be divided by 2, making 2 unique as the only even prime. All other prime numbers are odd.
Infinite number of primes: There is no upper limit to the number of prime numbers; they continue indefinitely. This was proven by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BCE.
No predictable pattern: Prime numbers don't follow a predictable formula. However, they do become less frequent as numbers get larger.
Examples of Prime Numbers:
The first few prime numbers are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
Notice that aside from 2, all prime numbers are odd.

Applications of Prime Numbers:
Cryptography: Prime numbers are fundamental in modern cryptographic algorithms, especially in RSA encryption. Large prime numbers are used to secure data transmission, making it difficult to break encryption without knowing the prime factors.

Number theory: Prime numbers are central to the study of number theory, which investigates the properties and relationships of numbers.

Mathematical Puzzles and Algorithms: Prime numbers play a role in various mathematical problems, algorithms, and puzzles, especially in fields related to optimization and random number generation.
